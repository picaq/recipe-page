        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>This is a quick recipe I devised to repopulate my git microbiota after a very strong course of antibiotics. Fantastic if you are a fan of fermented foods made with friendly microorganisms!</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>

                <li>Pour shreded cheese on top of both slices of sourdough bread</li>
                <li>Sprinkle desired amount of garlic powder into the cheese</li>
                <li>Heat the bread with ingredients face-up with desired heating method. I prefer microwaving for 1 minute, but 3 minutes in a toaster oven at medium shade is also sufficient</li>

                <li>Place Kimchi on one slice of sourdough on top of the cheese and chives</li>
                <li>Place the opposite slice of sourdough cheese-side down on top of the Kimchi</li>
